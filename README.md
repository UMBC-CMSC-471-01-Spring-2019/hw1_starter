# hw1_starter

Imagine that you are writing an opinion piece for The Retriever on the topic and explaining why we should or should not be worried about one or more dangers unleashed by AI. Your piece should be at least 250 words long and be written so it could be understood by the Retriever's audience. It should explain some aspect of the issue and why many people are concerned about it today, mention arguments on both sides of the controversy, present and argue for your own opinion. Oh, and think up a catchy headline.

Place a pdf file with your piece in your local repository named xxxxx_hw1.pdf where xxxxx is your umbc username (e.g., finin_hw1.pdf), use git to add and commit the file and push the changes back to the github repository.

Finally, summarize your op-ed piece in  a traditional tweet-length (i.e., at most 140 characters) comment to the Piazza thread HW1tweets.
